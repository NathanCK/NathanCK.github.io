        discription: "The project was to build an application to calculate energy usage for a specific period of time. One of the main focus I did was to implement a system for scheduling a computation at a specific time as a job. Also, I designed multiple RESTful endpoints for other systems to consume our calculation result and the meter data and to schedule a computation externally. In order to calculate thousand of jobs at a short period of time, I have involved in designing and implementing a caching system to hold all the meta data we would need for the calculation. Not only I would perform unit testing for the small parts of the system, but also I created a program to ensure the entire system is working properly."
